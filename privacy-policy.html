    <strong>LIVING – Mood Tracker</strong> (“the App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy.
  </p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal data when you use the App.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>A. Account Information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> Used for authentication and to associate your data with your account.</li>
    <li><strong>Display Name:</strong> Optional and editable.</li>
    <li>No profile pictures or files are uploaded.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>B. Mood Entries and App Usage Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Mood entries, timestamps, and optional notes are saved to Firebase Storage and associated with your account.</li>
    <li>Optional location data is collected only if you grant permission, and it is stored with each mood entry.</li>

    <li>The App does not record, transmit, or analyze the audio itself.</li>
    <li>
      If the source is external, your device may connect directly to that external server,
      which may have its own privacy practices outside our control.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>D. Analytics and Advertising Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We use Google Analytics for Firebase to collect anonymous usage statistics to improve user experience.</li>
    <li>For users on the Ad-Supported tier, the App may display banner ads served by third-party networks.</li>
    <li>
      These networks may collect device identifiers, usage data, and other non-personally identifying information
      to serve relevant ads.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your data to:</p>

  <p><strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong></p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Storage:</strong> The personal information we collect (such as mood entries, account details,
    and location data) is stored and processed on Google Firebase servers.
    By using the app, you acknowledge that your data may be transferred to and maintained
    on servers located outside of your state or country.

    including encryption at rest and in transit.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> While we take commercially reasonable precautions to protect your data,

    and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

  <p><strong>International Transfers:</strong></p>
  <p>
    If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK, your information will be transferred
    to and processed in the United States. We ensure a similar degree of protection by implementing
    at least one of the following safeguards:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission.
    </li>
    <li>
      Google’s certification under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework.
